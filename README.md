**MINI GREP is a CLI tool built in Rust by following `The Rust Book`** 

**A simple version of `ripgrep` created or developed by `Andrew Gallant`**

# what It does ?
It searches for a particular word in a specified file and prints lines that contains word. 
This tool takes two arguments while running the application, one is the word and the other is fileName

command : 
`cargo run -- word file.txt`

# Quick action ( or How to run ) 

1. clone the repo

3. run the command :

   ```
⚠ make sure that , you have that file( you specified in the command) in the folder
( I have added poem.txt in the repo , you can search for words in that poem file )
